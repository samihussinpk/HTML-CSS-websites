                <h2>Benefactor of Pakistan</h2>
                <p><b>Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan</b> was a Pakistani scientist. He played a pivotal role in nuclear weapons program development in Pakistan and abroad. His efforts to develop nuclear weapons through the enrichment of uranium and not plutonium allowed Pakistan to successfully develop weapons, which it had struggled to do previously. He also is credited with inventing gas-centrifuge enrichment technology for Pakistan's nuclear program. Additionally, he aided several nations with nuclear technology and information on developing nuclear programs.

                <h2>Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan's Early Life And Early Career</h2>
                <p>At the time of his birth in the mid-1930s, Abdul Qadeer Khan was born into the British Raj, or British India, which included several nation-states such as modern-day India and Pakistan. Khan was born at a time when the nations of India and Pakistan longed to be free of colonial rule. By the early 1940s, World War II was underway, and British India was a critical location for allied forces to combat Japanese forces in southeast Asia. Despite several uprisings within British India, Britain retained power throughout the war. At the conclusion of World War II, Britain was concerned by tensions continuing to grow in India and was aware of religious tensions among Hindus and Muslims. The crown was also concerned about the danger to British citizens from a previous mutiny. As a result, Britain sought to transfer the power of the British Raj to its people swiftly.
